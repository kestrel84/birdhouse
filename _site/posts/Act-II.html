      <h3>Session VIII (05/02/2026)</h3>
<p>So the PCs have just lifted a blade ship and some mysterious boxes or something from a random asteroid on the edge of the blacksphere. Then they get jumped by five shardships.</p>
<p>They'll be a dragon cruiser, two nautiloids and two turtleships, all overtaken by the black crystal - though the dragonhship not quite. It's actually an ambush orchestrated by Darius working with the Syndicate, of course; the PCs can find this out if they board any of the shardships - they'll find the interior only partially transformed, especially on the dragonship. It's pretty freaky, with the crystal growing slowly out of the engine rooms (channeled through glitter, see [[Brainstorming#Blacksphere corruption (added 2026-02-04)|this entry]])</p>
<p>The PCs will almost certainly elect to get the hell out of doge upon seeing the ships; so where do they end up?</p>
<p>Can't do the festival thingy since Az isn't here, save that for later. So... what? They'll be pretty close to the blacksphere...</p>
<p>Have them run into something in the astral sea, maybe? some curious character?</p>
<p>Perhaps, out of sheer chance, they run into a druid sect, aligned with the stargazers. A base of operations or something, supply post from before the cutoff, when it would have been much closer to the frontier. It's an island called , built around a sacred divination device, a much larger armillary sphere looking thing. Sprinkle in some rumours of the origins of the device as relating to illithids somehow. There are also peaceful starlight apparitions hanging around - glowing ghosts, basically. They whisper sometimes, but don't talk much.</p>
<p>![[starlight apparition.png]]</p>
<p>The main druid who greets them is called Ember, and she's a tiefling with kinda dark orangeish skin and ram horns. She's a fairly young druid, in her 40s or so, and harbours a grudge against the syndicate and the alliance after her family trading ship got caught in some meaningless shootout between the two on the border. The ship wound up drifting to the island, like many damaged ships do, and she elected to stay.</p>
<p>If the PCs ask for information on history of any kind or any information on the remnants or shardships, they get sent to the lower levels of the island to look at the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;hs=T9Hp&amp;sca_esv=b91b52423da4ab6e&amp;sxsrf=ANbL-n7iKmgxL8e7jEzxsQ7iYu7_zE40ng:1770235632060&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=ADc_l-aN0CWEZBOHjofHoaMMDiKpaEWjvZ2Py1XXV8d8KvlI3o6iwGk6Iv1tRbZIBNIVs-5-bUj3iBl-UxHsANYwOkWWQqZAJJdwuRaSoLHfELMHARurXwtwWmcdG4V-LDFDd8ej7SBqcB6EtTqzZn5Wt-4w2HJvbIGE808TW2HjQW_G0MvgZdG3UtbNn2WNfSOfgNsYtHFd5mt8qMNOCzHQj1MqDg38cw&amp;q=stone+stele&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjy8JHQ0cCSAxV-V0EAHRjjC9gQtKgLegQIGBAB&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1285&amp;dpr=1&amp;aic=0">steles</a>. There are two threats here: starlight apparitions and the tides of the astral sea.</p>
<p>The starlight apparitions <a href="https://online.anyflip.com/nxlax/scrg/mobile/index.html">(p59 in the menagerie)</a> found in the lower levels are even less interested in talking than the ones upstairs, and attack on sight. As for the tides, some parts of the lower levels are below the high tide mark of the astral sea, and waves constantly (around every twelve seconds/two rounds or so) wash over them. Anyone who's on the lower levels when a wave comes across takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage from being hit by a wave, and must succeed on a DC 14 dex save or be washed away, at which point they are trying to swim in the astral sea. It's pretty easy to float, somehow, but they'll be at the mercy of the currents.</p>
<p>The basic information on the steles is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The blacksphere was created by someone, somewhere</li>
<li>The remnants are linked to it, but the stele lists effects on small quantities of glitter right next to the sphere; not the kind of stuff that's happening now.</li>
<li>There was some kind of illithid presence in the mid-circles before the majority of people got there. The peraxian empire spent a lot of time fighting illithid ships when it first tried to colonise the system a few hundred years back (time unclear from the steles, but longer than living memory for any race).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Session IX (12/02/2026)</h3>
<p>The PCs successfully escaped the shardships and arrived at the stargazer's astral isle. They talked to ember (who just backstory dumped lmao, avoid that in the future) who directed them down into the basement. they went there and discovered:</p>
<ul>
<li>starlight apparitions</li>
<li>the illithids were involved with this island somehow</li>
<li>glitter turns into crystal near the blacksphere? or something?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now they're down there and need to find out more without getting killed, posessed or washed away. They'll encounter first one starlight apparition, then depending on how it goes, three more.</p>
<p>Roughly, they find out the info as above, plus that the blacksphere channels weave through glitter and humans and some creatures, corrupting it to black crystal of some kind. how darius controls it is still a mystery.</p>
<p>After they get back, ember'll help with decoding their <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:astromancy-archive">astromancy archive</a>, where they find out it can also cast locate creature and locate object. She also gives them a pole-vault spear (+1,  can move to any side of enemy after attacking, +10ft jump height/length)</p>
<p>Then they head to Yuncheng (festival rock). As per [[Act I-II Planning|the planning doc]], they run into Az's old crew in the back of the tavern, then get roped in to rescue the circus. Perhaps they have some remnants chained up in the back which the PCs need to take out in order to save the show.</p>
<h3>Session X (20/02/2026)</h3>
<p>Some stuff from last session:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stargazer (probably [[Brainstorming#Eivor &amp; Rose|rose]]) knows about pre-cutoff peraxian blacksphere research and the elf involved (it's [[Brainstorming#Shuri Sobek|shuri]] lmao)</li>
<li>A different stargazer by the name of Silas is the one who experimented next to the blacksphere and first discovered remnants/remnant crystal (the black stuff).</li>
<li>The 'locate person' and 'locate object' on the astro archive have <em>substantially</em> larger range - a couple of systems or so.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the PCs head over to Yuncheng and drop off the cargo. Az meets up with some of his old buddies and learns over a hellbeer that there's some nefarious goings-on at the festival. There's rumours of some gladiatorial combat supposedly taking place at the festival on the weekend, and the festival's been running very tight margins and doesn't have the money for a healer or resurrections.</p>
<p>Some ideas for magic acts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The top of the tent opens up for a fireworks display (it has glyphs on the top)</li>
<li>Precision flying (tossed flaming rings) - an act called 'the seven rings of fire'</li>
<li>highly elaborate rope-swinging trapeze-type thing, taking advantage of the low gees</li>
<li>Exotic performing animals (gryphon, space hamster)</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic setup is that there are some remnant bozos hiding in with the performing animals for the gladiatorial combat. Darius is in the audience as a guest of the syndicate, in order to show off the fighting troops he's just given them. The syndicate know that the PCs are coming (they overheard Az in the tavern), so they've lent the otherwise fairly defenceless circus some veterans and mages (MM 348 and 7 respectively). However, if the PCs raid immediately (within a few hours) then the syndicate don't have time to pull it off.</p>
<p>See <strong>The Tome</strong> for the map of the circus campus. Notable features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A storeroom with a bunch of random magic bits and bobs inside (a lot of firework stuff as well)</li>
<li>The back courtyardy area has a shitload of rigging and wiring between the four smaller tents, the big top and the backstage, with some explosives attatched at various points.</li>
<li>There's a watchtower with a mage on it in the back corner</li>
<li>There's a twenty-minute daylight cycle and the back courtyard is poorly lit by a single torch</li>
</ul>
<p>Notable characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The festival master - Inverio, an old aasimar, crafty one with a couple scars on his wing; ex-stunt performer and always on the hunt for growth and the next big thing. Will take any risk, currently in bed with the syndicate in secret from his performers. Was the one who sold out to YGMC.</li>
<li>The current lead wiremaster - Thalia Fortuna, a tiefling from "far away". Makes extensive use of her tail in her stunts. Flirty, but secretly in love with the gladiator. Dark, ashen skin, piercing hot pink eyes and an afro with edges dyed to match.</li>
<li>The gladiator -  Danny Robinson, a young man putting on an innocent facade who only joined the circus on their last show. A sorceror trying to pass as john human fighter after a particularly traumatic and isolating upbringing. Thalia has figured him out, but no-one else.</li>
<li>The leader of the seven rings - An aaracokra called Graal, been running with the festival for a long, long time, considering retirement. You can see the singed edges on his wings. The rest of the seven rings are extremely respectful of him. Thinks selling out a few years back was a bad call, lost them a lot of talent. The rest of the seven rings are each of a different race, using magic tatoos to fly around:
<ul>
<li>Heimdall, a half-elf</li>
<li>Vane, a dragonborn. Manifests illusory dragon wings during flight.</li>
<li>Lars, a dohwar</li>
<li>Renzo, a hadozee</li>
<li>Oraxia, an air genasi</li>
<li>Perrin, a human</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fireworks maestro - Jackson Silver, an ex-merc giff with a thing for cannons. Hates the syndicate after they wrecked his old ship, and will refit the storm chaser with some fancy new ordnance if they tell him about it and then fix it.
There are a bunch more people in the circus - some musicians, a few more junior wire jockeys, and some administrative/helper flunkeys.</li>
</ul>
<p>To top it all off, someone from the circus knows where to find carter (three systems coreward, roughly, at the [[Brainstorming#Golantio Observatory|observatory]]).</p>
<h3>Session XI (26/02/2026)</h3>
<p>What happened last session:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PCs did some shopping</li>
<li>Like a lot of shopping</li>
<li>They snuck into the circus, then met a hadozee helper out front called jimmy. He was pissed about being posted outside during dinner time and told them a bunch of stuff</li>
<li>They met up with Thalia and Danny, who are more dating than secretly in love, and found out that the festival master is more unpopular than ever.</li>
<li>Some more shopping</li>
<li>They met up with Thalia and Danny in a side alley, and agreed to try and fight the remnants. Precisely what's going to happen is not quite decided, and they still have a day to go.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PCs have two options - fight the remnants in the back lot, where it'll be safer for civvies but there are a bunch of syndicate goons, or fight in the arena, without the extra goons and possibly with danny, but where darius and a bunch of civvies are.</p>
<p>Also, Jackson wants to contact them after the events, tell them to head on to the observatory, after refitting their ship with some proper ordnance. If they contact him beforehand (somehow) he'll also rig up some fireworks around the place to help the PCs out.</p>
<p>Besides that, it's just a big fight, basically.</p>
<p>The place the PCs are going next is the golantio observatory, where they'll find carter and directions to the elven fleet, possibly after some shenanigans or something.</p>
